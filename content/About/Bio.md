## Education
I attended the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities from 2018 to 2022, when I graduated from
the College of Science and Engineering (CSE) with a B.S. in Computer Science with high distinction.

I also did a dual degree program with the College of Liberal Arts (CLA), graduating with a B.S. in
Statistical Science with high distinction.

My overall GPA throughout college was 3.967/4. I was on the Dean's List for CSE all 8 semesters,
and was on the Dean's List for CLA the 4 semesters I was dual-enrolled in both colleges.

Some highlighted courses I took during my time at the U include:
- Algorithms and Data Structures (CSCI 4041)
- Machine Learning Fundamentals (CSCI 5521)
- Advanced Machine Learning (CSCI 5525)
- Practice of Database Systems (CSCI 4707)
- Visualization (CSCI 5707)
- Data Science II (INET 4710)
- Communication for Statisticians (STAT 4893W)
- Non-parametric Methods (STAT 5601)
- Time Series Analysis (STAT 5511)

Outside of academics, I was an active member of the Chinese American Student Association
on campus for all four years I was a student.
I served as a board member my Sophomore and Junior years, as secretary and internal vice
president, respectively. As secretary, I managed the organization's inventory, note-taking, and
email distribution. 
As internal vice president, I led more meetings and projects (e.g., to put on events or create content),
ensured tasks were being completed to meet deadlines, held 1-1s with other board members
to ensure they had pleasant tenures, and in general took on a more executive role.
My senior year, I was an advisor for the board.

## Work Experience
### Internships
In the summer of 2019, I was a software engineering intern at Virtual Radiologic (vRad), a teleradiology
company in Eden Prairie, MN.
- Internal software for managing radiologist schedules; worked as part of an established team
- SQL - C# - JavaScript (React) stack, worked most closely with the C# and JavaScript layers
- Enhanced existing workflows by building a tool to show the most common radiologist schedule, data view filters, and frontend modal enhancements.

In the summer of 2020, I was a software engineering intern at Format Solutions, a Cargill company, in Hopkins, MN;
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this internship was conducted remotely. 
- Commercial software, intended for farmers to balance and optimize animal feed costs vs. nutrition; worked as part of an established team
- C# - JavaScript (React) stack again
- Built out new views as well as feature gates that would change workflows (showing / masking certain steps) depending on user authorization
- Helped refine and stabilize the application as part of UAT

In the summer of 2021, I was a software engineering intern at First Republic Bank in San Francisco, CA; again, due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, this internship was conducted remotely. 
- Internal software developed completely from scratch; a more typical standalone intern project
- Completely C#; backend-only application using the GitHub API to crawl through repositories, pulling down information about pull requests and SDLC compliance
- Devised scoring metrics to gauge how well pull requests adhered to SDLC standards; information could be saved locally or persisted to ElasticSearch for visualization and rollup 

### Full-Time
After graduating college, I returned to First Republic as a full-time software engineer, starting in September 2022.
- Part of a development team building a new, backend-only application that utilized Confluent Kafka to enable event-driven architecture
- App subscribed to a configurable list of Kafka topics, ingested and sanitized events from those topics, and emitted those events to configurable output topics
- C#, utilizing language-specific features like Microsoft Roslyn for code generation, as well as external libraries like NewRelic for application monitoring

After First Republic Bank failed and was bought by JPMorgan Chase, I worked for JPMorgan for just over a year,
from May 2023 to July 2024.
- Primarily maintained a Kafka message routing application.
- App provided a configurable and scalable means of ingesting events from Kafka topics and either re-publishing them to other topics, or sending them to API endpoints via HTTP. 

As of July 2024, I'm looking for new opportunities! (please feel free to reach out)

I'm also familiar with a variety of development or development-adjacent tools, namely:
- GitHub
- Atlassian Jira and Confluence
- Jenkins
- NewRelic (for application monitoring)
- Confluent Kafka (especially for .NET)
- Microsoft Roslyn (for code generation)
