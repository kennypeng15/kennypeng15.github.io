## Education
I attended the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities from 2018 to 2022, when I graduated from
the College of Science and Engineering (CSE) with a B.S. in Computer Science with high distinction.

I also did a dual degree program with the College of Liberal Arts (CLA), graduating with a B.S. in
Statistical Science with high distinction.

My overall GPA throughout college was 3.967/4. I was on the Dean's List for CSE all 8 semesters,
and was on the Dean's List for CLA the 4 semesters I was dual-enrolled in both colleges.

Some highlighted courses I took during my time at the U include:
- Algorithms and Data Structures (CSCI 4041)
- Machine Learning Fundamentals (CSCI 5521)
- Advanced Machine Learning (CSCI 5525)
- Practice of Database Systems (CSCI 4707)
- Visualization (CSCI 5707)
- Data Science II (INET 4710)
- Communication for Statisticians (STAT 4893W)
- Non-parametric Methods (STAT 5601)
- Time Series Analysis (STAT 5511)

Outside of academics, I was an active member of the Chinese American Student Association
on campus for all four years I was a student.
I served as a board member my Sophomore and Junior years, as secretary and internal vice
president, respectively. As secretary, I managed the organization's inventory, note-taking, and
email distribution. 
As internal vice president, I led more meetings and projects (e.g., to put on events or create content),
ensured tasks were being completed to meet deadlines, held 1-1s with other board members
to ensure they had a pleasant tenures, and in general took on a more executive role.
My senior year, I was an advisor for the board.

## Work Experience
(more about my work experience and what I did, especially for current positions, will come later)

### Internships
In the summer of 2019, I was a software engineering intern at Virtual Radiologic (vRad), a teleradiology
company in Eden Prairie, MN.
- Internal software for managing radiologist schedules; worked as part of an established team
- SQL - C# - JavaScript (React) stack, worked most closely with the C# and JavaScript layers
- Enhanced existing workflows by building a tool to show the most common radiologist schedule, data view filters, and frontend modal enhancements.

In the summer of 2020, I was a software engineering intern at Format Solutions, a Cargill company, in Hopkins, MN;
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this internship was conducted remotely. 
- Commercial software, intended for farmers to balance and optimize animal feed costs vs. nutrition; worked as part of an established team
- C# - JavaScript (React) stack again
- Built out new views as well as feature gates that would change workflows (showing / masking certain steps) depending on user authorization
- Helped refine and stabilize the application as part of UAT

In the summer of 2021, I was a software engineering intern at First Republic Bank in San Francisco, CA; again, due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, this internship was conducted remotely. 
- Internal software developed completely from scratch; a more typical standalone intern project
- Completely C#; backend-only application using the GitHub API to crawl through repositories, pulling down information about pull requests and SDLC compliance
- Devised scoring metrics to gauge how well pull requests adhered to SDLC standards; information could be saved locally or persisted to ElasticSearch for visualization and rollup 

### Full-Time
After graduating college, I returned to First Republic as a full-time software engineer.

I currently work for JPMorgan Chase.

- R
- JavaScript (primarily with React)
- SQL

I'm also familiar with a variety of development or development-adjacent tools, namely:
- GitHub
- Atlassian Jira and Confluence
- Jenkins
- NewRelic (for application monitoring)
- Confluent Kafka (especially for .NET)
- Microsoft Roslyn (for code generation)
