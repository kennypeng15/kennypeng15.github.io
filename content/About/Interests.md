## Professional
In general, I'm very happy doing application development. 
I have experience with full-stack development as well as developing backend-only applications, I've worked on 
internal-only and commercial applications, and I've both developed apps from scratch and have improved existing ones.

I'm fond of data analysis and data exploration applications (anything ranging from simple data displays
to full-on machine learning type problems). I've always enjoyed looking through data,
graphs, and other visualizations to draw conclusions (hence my Statistics major in undergrad).
I enjoy building things that contextualize, interpret, and really tell stories with data.

That being said, as a developer early on in my career, I'm more than willing to try just about anything!
I love solving problems, and am always striving to learn new things and gain experience that will help me become
a better problem solver.

I pride myself on solving problems well - not just finding a solution that works, but finding ones that are 
rigorous, simple (if possible), and providing high-quality accompanimental items with them (tests, documentation,
teach-in sessions, you name it).

### Industries of Interest
I'm open to working in just about any kind of industry! As alluded to above, I'm more keen on working in environments
where I can tackle challenging problems, learn, and grow as much as possible.

That being said, I do think some industries are appealing due to personal interest in their subject matter, 
namely, agriculture, biology, and healthcare (and their -tech derivatives).

Education is also an interest of mine; I'm not sure if that means working in ed-tech or becoming some kind
of lecturer later on in my career, but I do think it'd be enjoyable to teach or in some way aid teachers.

### Technologies of Interest
I'm most comfortable working with C# / .NET (with which I have the most professional experience), JavaScript (mostly using React), 
and python.
Again, however, I'm more than willing to learn just about any language or framework.

I'm interested in cloud technologies as well. I'm most familiar with AWS, having earned the AWS Solutions Architect: Associate
certification in the fall of 2023. I've also used AWS for my personal projects, such as [MineTracker]({{% relref "../Projects/MineTracker" %}}).

## Personal
### Music
I'm very fond of playing the piano in my free time! 
Here's a clip of me playing Lowell Liebermann's Gargoyles, No. 3; it was recorded in 2018 at [Wells Pianos](https://www.wellspianos.com/) 
in Minnesota for a competition audition.

I also play the cello, and very much enjoy playing in orchestral settings - I was a member of the [Greater Twin Cities Youth Symphonies](https://gtcys.org/)
in high school and a part of the UMN's Campus Orchestra in college. I wasn't able to bring my cello to San Francisco when I moved, however, so I haven't
played recently.

### Random Subject Matter
I also have my fair share of topics that I'm fascinated by for no particular reason, including:
- Ancient Egypt (especially mummification, I always found that interesting as a kid)
- Parasitism, especially in insects ([Plight of the Living Dead](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/553657/plight-of-the-living-dead-by-matt-simon/) is great!)
- Marine biology; I actually wanted to be a marine biologist when I was in early grade school
- Paleontology
